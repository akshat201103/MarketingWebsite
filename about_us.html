At Lovely Autos, all the Used Cars go through a comprehensive background check before they are put up for sale. The pre-sales checks include checking of the original documents, including the insurance, registration certificate, kilometres run by the car, chassis number, registration number and much more. A check of the owner’s profile as well as of the car’s service history is also conducted to ensure that the car’s documents and the owner’s history are an exact match. Apart from these, many other important checks are conducted on every car, all in an effort to offer the best pre-owned cars in India to you. Only the highest quality of pre-owned cars are presented to Lovely Autos customers for a safe and exciting car-owning experience.
